# S3 
## intro
S3 instances hold data, the data can then later be accessed via url,

we can upload and create s3 from the awscli comand library package

this package allows us to create and change buckets that hold the data.

any image or text file or other data can then be accessed from the URl of the bucket and a specified url
![cat](image.png)
![Alt text](image-1.png)

we see that the picture can be changed
this is done in the steps

## Steps
1. deploying the app
2. creating and using bucket image
3. reverting

each step is a script that can be run, and running either one of the latter 2 will change the image back and forth

## the code for all 3 is here:
